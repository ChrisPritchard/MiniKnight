# MiniKnight

A pixel-art platformer where you must fight your way to the portal, collecting coins and slaying orcs along the way!

## !!! Work in Progress !!!

Coded in F# on dotnet core 2.1. Developed using VS Code 1.25.0 on Windows 10. Game loop engine is MonoGame 3.7

## Supported platforms

Being dotnet core 2.1, it should work on all platforms that supports (Windows, Linux, Mac). Tested (and largely coded on) Windows 10. A full list of dotnet core supported platforms can be found from here: <https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1-supported-os.md>

I built this using VS Code, but have also tested opening and running on Visual Studio 2017.

A note for mac users: part of the compilation of this game involves building the content, done using a MonoGame content builder referenced via Nuget. On OSX, this component does not work with just dotnet core. I have managed to get it going by doing the following:

- Installing the latest version of LTS Mono from here (version 5.12.0): <http://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/#download-mac>
- Installing the latest version of the MonoGame standalone pipeline builder for OSX from here (Pipeline.MacOS.pkg, v3.6): <http://www.monogame.net/2017/03/01/monogame-3-6/>
- Doing a sudo dotnet restore and a sudo dotnet build

After the build succeeded, a sudo dotnet run started the game without issue.
